- When user logs in, he gets a session cookie and xsrf token (session seems to be important)
- Every GET to page sets both new cookie which seem to expire after 2 hours. If not logged in, it sets both too but they not associated with login
- Say user goes to root page,it checks if cookie is associated with a login. If not, redirects to login
- Remeber me sets a cookie for an year and with that, all page return ok no matter other cookies sent
- Checking after how much time cookie expires
- Expires after 2 hrs ish


After running for 3 days, wroked fine but suddenly got 403. They just implemented cf clearance stuff for everyone even logged out users. Needing the cf clearance on main request.

Now after few hrs, they changed and now a post request to their cdn cf sets the cookie but it doesnt require. 


I am gonna set a pupeeer instance to get cf clearance and then use that also set browser headers.
